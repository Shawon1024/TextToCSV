# Convert a Text File to a CSV File using Python Notebook

In this code, I have demonstrated how to convert a .txt formated file to a .csv formated file which can be later used for other purposes.

I have a .txt file containing the sensor data from MPU6050 which is 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope sensor. I use this sensor for my project and collected data in .txt file format. but for machine learning coding, I prefered using .csv file format and converted the data file to it.

The code involves reading the data, adding columns if the data doesn't have any and save it to .csv file.
